## Generated Plots

### 1. ✅ Drift Rate Story - Across Difficulty Levels
**File:** `output/figures/plot1_drift_rate_by_difficulty.png`

**Description:**
- Shows drift rate (v) for Standard, Hard, and Easy trials
- Forest plot style with error bars (95% CrI)
- Visualizes the dramatic swing from negative drift (Standard/Hard) to positive drift (Easy)
- Demonstrates signal-to-noise ratio quality of stimuli

**Key Features:**
- Reference line at v = 0
- Color-coded by direction (negative = crimson, positive = blue)
- Error bars show uncertainty

---

### 2. ✅ Bias Story - ADT vs VDT
**File:** `output/figures/plot2_bias_by_task.png`

**Description:**
- Shows starting-point bias (z) for ADT vs VDT tasks
- Point-range plot with error bars (95% CrI)
- Demonstrates modality-specific decision criteria
- Reference line at z = 0.5 (no bias)

**Key Features:**
- ADT: z ≈ 0.573 (57.3% bias toward "Different")
- VDT: z ≈ 0.534 (53.4% bias toward "Different")
- VDT has significantly lower bias than ADT

### 3. ✅ PPC Validation Plot
**File:** `output/figures/plot3_ppc_validation.png`

**Description:**
- Histogram of predicted "Different" proportions from posterior predictive check
- Shows observed proportion (10.9%) vs predicted (11.2%)
- Demonstrates model accurately recovers data distribution
- Validates hierarchical model against aggregation bias

**Key Features:**
- Observed line (red dashed)
- Predicted mean (blue solid)
- 95% credible interval (orange dotted)
- Validates model fit

---

### 4. ✅ Parameter Correlations - Subject Random Effects
**File:** `output/figures/plot4_parameter_correlation.png`

**Description:**
- Scatter plot of subject-level drift intercept vs bias intercept
- Shows individual differences in parameter estimates
- Correlation: r = -0.205

**Key Features:**
- Each point = one subject (n = 67)
- Linear fit line with confidence interval
- Negative correlation suggests subjects with stronger negative drift have less bias toward "Different"

---

## Visual Design

**Color Scheme (Consistent with Manuscript):**
- Blue (`#1f78b4`): "Different" responses, positive drift, ADT
- Crimson (`#DC143C`): "Same" responses, negative drift, VDT

**Publication Quality:**
- ✅ 300 DPI resolution
- ✅ Clean, minimal theme
- ✅ Clear labels and captions
- ✅ Error bars showing 95% credible intervals
