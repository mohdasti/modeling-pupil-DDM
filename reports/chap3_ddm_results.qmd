# Abstract

This chapter presents a hierarchical Wiener diffusion decision model (DDM) for a response-signal change-detection task in older adults. The primary model maps task difficulty to drift rate (v), boundary separation (a), and starting-point bias (z), with small condition effects on non-decision time (t₀). We report comprehensive quality assurance checks, manipulation checks independent of the DDM, model comparison via LOO cross-validation, and extensive posterior predictive checks with emphasis on subject-wise mid-body RT quantiles.

# Introduction

## Age-Related Slowing and Strategic Adaptation in Decision-Making

A hallmark of cognitive aging is a pervasive slowing of response times across virtually all task domains. Older adults consistently take longer to respond in speeded decision tasks than younger adults, a phenomenon historically interpreted as *generalized slowing* [@birren1965age; @salthouse1985speed]. Classic analyses using Brinley plots [@brinley1965cognitive], which linearly relate older adults' reaction times to younger adults', supported the idea of a global factor that uniformly slows processing with age [@cerella1985; @salthouse1996]. Indeed, increased age is associated with a decrease in the speed of many mental operations, as posited by the processing-speed theory of cognitive aging [@salthouse1996]. However, simply viewing aging as a uniform "slower clock speed" obscures important nuances. Older adults often maintain accuracy rates comparable to younger adults by adjusting their decision-making strategy: they tend to respond more cautiously, emphasizing accuracy over speed. In other words, rather than being a passive consequence of a slower brain, longer response times in older people can reflect an active, strategic adaptation aimed at preserving accuracy in the face of cognitive and neural challenges. Empirical evidence for this adaptive strategy comes from speed--accuracy tradeoff studies showing that, when given the option, seniors favor slower, more accurate responding, whereas younger adults are willing to respond faster at the cost of more errors [@rabbitt1979old; @starns2010effects]. This age-related shift toward a "slow but sure" decision mode is often interpreted as an adaptive mechanism: older adults may consciously or unconsciously slow down to avoid mistakes, compensating for declines in sensory or cognitive processing by "buying" extra decision time.

Notably, this cautious response style means that aging effects on decision performance are not uniform across all components of processing. Contemporary cognitive aging models distinguish between generalized slowing and component-specific changes in decision dynamics. For example, older adults experience sensory and perceptual degradations, often conceptualized as a reduction in neural signal-to-noise ratio [@li2001aging; @lindenberger1994sensory], as well as distinct motor slowing [@seidler2010motor], which each can prolong portions of the response time independent of decision strategy. At the same time, older adults exhibit changes in decision criteria, such as setting a higher threshold for required evidence before responding [@ratcliff2007application; @ratcliff2008diffusion; @ratcliff2004aging]. This raises an important question: does aging slow the core cognitive processing speed, or do older adults simply recalibrate their speed--accuracy tradeoff by becoming more cautious? The answer appears to be a combination of both, depending on task demands. In relatively simple perceptual decision tasks—such as brightness discrimination or letter identification—healthy older adults often achieve accuracy similar to young adults by adopting conservative decision thresholds and taking more time, rather than by significantly improving the quality of evidence they accumulate [@ratcliff2001aging; @ratcliff2003diffusion]. Their slower responses thus reflect a strategic emphasis on accuracy (criterion shift) and slower peripheral processes, rather than a grossly deficient ability to process information. However, under more challenging conditions -- tasks with high complexity, heavy memory reliance, or speed pressure [@starns2010] -- older adults may face genuine declines in cognitive processing efficiency in addition to their strategic caution. In such cases, seniors sometimes cannot maintain the same quality of evidence accumulation as the young, leading to lower accuracy or greater performance decrements when they try to respond faster. Research has shown, for instance, that in difficult episodic recognition memory tasks (e.g., distinguishing studied words from new ones), older adults exhibit slower rates of evidence accumulation (drift rates) than younger adults, indicating real declines in the quality of decision-driving information available to them [@spaniol2006]. Notably, this decline in drift rate was observed in memory retrieval but was absent in simpler lexical decision tasks within the same study, reinforcing that processing efficiency deficits are often domain-specific. Likewise, in complex visual searches requiring serial attention allocation, aging is associated with less efficient evidence sampling and higher information requirements to reach a decision criterion [@madden1991]. These findings underscore that aging impacts decision-making through multiple pathways: a general tendency toward slower, more cautious responding, coupled with task-specific deficits in processing speed or quality when cognitive demands exceed the older brain's capacity.

## Insights from Drift-Diffusion Modeling of Aging

To disentangle these component processes of decision-making, researchers increasingly turn to computational modeling approaches. One powerful framework is the Drift Diffusion Model (DDM), which provides a quantitative decomposition of choice reaction time data into psychologically interpretable parameters [@ratcliff1978theory; @ratcliff2008diffusion]. In a simple two-choice decision task, the DDM conceptualizes the process as a gradual, noisy accumulation of evidence toward one of two decision boundaries (representing the response options). The key model parameters include:

-   **Drift rate (v)** -- the average speed of evidence accumulation toward the correct decision. This reflects the quality or efficiency of information processing; a higher drift rate means the decision maker can extract and use task-relevant information more quickly.
-   **Decision boundary (a)** -- the amount of evidence required to commit to a choice, often interpreted as response caution or threshold. A larger boundary separation indicates a more cautious strategy (waiting for more evidence before deciding), whereas a smaller boundary implies a more impulsive or speed-emphasizing strategy.
-   **Starting point (z)** -- the initial bias or predisposition toward one option or the other before evidence is accumulated. If the starting point is centered (typically 0.5 in relative units), there is no pre-existing bias; deviations from center indicate an a priori bias to favor a particular response (e.g., a bias to say "yes" vs "no" in a detection task).
-   **Non-decision time (t₀)** -- the duration of processes outside of the evidence accumulation itself, such as perceptual encoding of the stimulus and the motor execution of the response. Non-decision time accounts for aspects of the reaction time that are not decision-related.

Evidence accumulates from a starting point (z, starting-point bias) toward one of two decision boundaries: the upper boundary corresponds to \"different\" responses, and the lower boundary to \"same\" responses. The rate of evidence accumulation is determined by the drift rate (v), which reflects the quality of the stimulus evidence. The distance between boundaries is the boundary separation (a), which reflects response caution. The total reaction time (RT) is the sum of non-decision time (t₀, reflecting motor execution and response selection in the response-signal design) and the decision time (time to reach a boundary). In this example, the starting point is biased toward the upper boundary (z > 0.5), and positive drift leads to a \"different\" response."

Formally, the evidence accumulation process follows the stochastic differential equation [@ratcliff1978theory; @ratcliff2008diffusion]:

$$dX(t) = v \, dt + dW(t)$$ {#eq-sde}

where $X(t)$ is the accumulated evidence at time $t$, $v$ is the drift rate (evidence strength), and $dW(t)$ is a Wiener noise process with unit variance. The process starts at $X(0) = z \cdot a$, where $z \in [0,1]$ is the starting-point bias (expressed as a proportion of boundary separation) and $a > 0$ is the boundary separation [@ratcliff2008diffusion]. The decision process terminates when $X(t)$ reaches either the upper boundary ($X(t) = a$) or the lower boundary ($X(t) = 0$). The total reaction time (RT) is the sum of the decision time and the non-decision time ($t_0$):

$$\text{RT} = t_{\text{decision}} + t_0$$ {#eq-rt}

By fitting the DDM to participants' accuracy and response time distributions, one can infer how these latent parameters differ between groups (e.g. young vs. old) or conditions. This model-based approach has proved especially illuminating in aging research. Rather than relying on overall slowing measures alone, the DDM allows researchers to pinpoint which aspects of processing slow down or change with age and which remain intact.

Findings from diffusion modeling consistently indicate that older adults' slower responses are largely due to shifts in caution and peripheral processing, rather than uniformly impaired evidence accumulation. Across a variety of tasks -- including perceptual discriminations, lexical decisions, and recognition memory -- older adults set significantly higher decision thresholds (larger *a*) than younger adults, meaning they require more accumulated evidence before making a choice. This conservative criterion is a logical strategy to maintain accuracy: by gathering more evidence, older adults can offset moderate declines in processing efficiency and counteract the increased internal noise that often comes with aging. At the same time, older adults typically exhibit prolonged non-decision times relative to young adults [@ratcliff2004aging]. Slower sensory encoding and motor execution in aging contribute to longer overall reaction times independent of decision caution. For example, Ratcliff, Thapar, and McKoon (2004) found that in a lexical decision task, seniors matched the accuracy of younger adults by widening their decision bounds, and their non-decision time was about 80--100 ms longer on average. Large-sample studies have corroborated that motor response slowing is a robust part of aging: even simple reaction tasks show older adults have delayed response initiation and execution, providing a physiological basis for longer non-decision components in older cohorts [@woods2015age]. Crucially, however, many studies report that drift rates (v) in older adults are only modestly reduced or even equivalent to those of younger adults in easier tasks, once older adults are given enough time or adopt their preferred cautious pace. In other words, when accuracy is emphasized and ample time is allowed, the quality of evidence accumulation in healthy older adults can remain surprisingly intact. This suggests that the fundamental cognitive processing of information -- at least for simpler or well-practiced decisions -- is not categorically devastated by age; rather, older adults' brains can still accumulate evidence effectively, but they do so more slowly overall because they wait for more evidence (higher *a*) and take longer to perceive and execute responses (longer t₀). This ability to preserve drift rate given sufficient time aligns with the earlier idea of a strategic compensation: older adults effectively trade speed for accuracy to maintain performance levels. Indeed, by intentionally slowing down, older adults often achieve nearly the same accuracy as young adults, indicating that the core decision process can function adequately if compensatory time is provided.

That being said, the preservation of drift rate in aging is not universal. The extent to which evidence accumulation speed declines with age depends on task domain and difficulty. In tasks that heavily tax memory retrieval, associative reasoning, or executive control, older adults do show reduced drift rates compared to young adults. For instance, in recognition memory tasks requiring recollection of specific contextual details, older adults accumulate evidence more slowly, reflecting age-related deficits in recollecting high-fidelity details [@spaniol2006]. Similarly, under conditions of divided attention or high cognitive load, older individuals cannot sustain the same drift rates, indicating a drop in processing efficacy when multitasking or when the task is very challenging [@madden1991; @ratcliff2010]. Additionally, older adults are often less flexible in adjusting their decision criteria in response to changing task demands. Younger adults can readily lower their decision threshold when speed is paramount, but older adults are slower to abandon caution even when a task incentivizes quick responses. Starns and Ratcliff (2010), for example, demonstrated that older adults set their decision bounds much wider than young adults even in situations where a more liberal, speed-oriented criterion would have been optimal [@starns2010]. This "suboptimal" conservatism suggests an age-related rigidity in speed--accuracy compromise: older adults prioritize error avoidance to such a degree that they sometimes forsake potential gains in efficiency. In sum, diffusion modeling has revealed two central points about cognitive aging: (1) Criterion setting: older adults characteristically raise their decision thresholds, contributing to slower but more error-averse performance; (2) Evidence quality: in many simple tasks the quality of evidence accumulation (drift) is relatively preserved in older age, but in more complex or resource-demanding tasks, drift rate can decline, indicating true processing limitations emerging alongside strategic caution. Furthermore, the DDM allows examination of bias (starting point z): while many studies find that healthy older adults do not exhibit strong pre-decision biases on average (they can often maintain an unbiased criterion in simple two-choice tasks), any systematic biases that do occur (for example, a predisposition to favor a "safe" response in a risk-laden choice) can be detected via model parameters. Bias has generally been a secondary consideration in cognitive aging, but it remains important to monitor -- changes in bias with age could reflect shifts in motivation or expectations (e.g. older adults might be biased toward saying "no" in memory tests to avoid false alarms, indicating a conservative response tendency). Overall, the application of drift-diffusion modeling provides a nuanced portrait of how aging influences decision-making mechanisms, separating the strategic adaptations from the fundamental cognitive changes that together produce the observable behavior.

Having established the baseline decision-making profile of older adults -- slower responses due to higher caution and longer nondecision latencies, with drift rates largely intact except under high difficulty -- we turn to an important modulating factor: arousal and effort. In this chapter, we leverage the diffusion model to investigate how fluctuations in arousal (induced via effort) can alter these latent decision processes in older adults. Aging not only changes the baseline speed--accuracy tradeoff, but may also interact with arousal in complex ways that further affect decision dynamics.

## Arousal, Effort, and Decision Performance in Older Adults

Beyond baseline aging effects, cognitive performance is strongly influenced by the organism's arousal state -- the level of alertness or activation of physiological and neural systems. Classic theory, dating back to the Yerkes--Dodson law [@yerkes1908], holds that the relationship between arousal and performance follows an inverted-U function: increasing arousal enhances performance up to an optimal point, after which further arousal (especially if reaching stress or anxiety levels) impairs performance. Moderate arousal can sharpen attention, quicken reaction times, and improve focus, whereas excessive arousal can introduce noise, distractibility, or hasty reactions that degrade performance. Empirical research in younger adults confirms that factors which heighten arousal -- such as time pressure, acute stress, stimulants, or high stakes -- can have mixed effects on decision-making. For instance, heightened arousal often speeds up responses, consistent with increased energy or urgency, but it can also lead to more variable or biased choices if arousal overshoots the optimum and induces jitteriness or "fight-or-flight" responses. In younger individuals, high arousal states sometimes promote impulsivity (e.g. jumping to decisions with less evidence) or cause lapses in attention, thereby reducing decision quality even as raw speed increases.

In the context of aging, arousal and effort dynamics take on special significance. Older adults typically have a reduced physiological capacity to sustain high arousal -- due to changes in cardiovascular, endocrine, and autonomic nervous system function -- yet they often need to exert greater mental effort to perform a given task at the same level as a younger person. This means older adults are frequently operating closer to their arousal limits during challenging cognitive activities. Recent studies support the idea that effortful engagement is more taxing for older adults in measurable ways. For example, Hess and Ennis (2012) demonstrated that when young and older adults were asked to perform cognitive tasks, older adults showed significantly larger increases in systolic blood pressure (SBP) -- a physiological index of effortful arousal -- than young adults doing the same tasks [@hess2012]. Moreover, as task difficulty increased, older adults' SBP reactivity rose disproportionately, indicating that they had to summon substantially more arousal/effort to meet the task demands. Importantly, Hess and Ennis also found that after engaging in a difficult initial task, older adults suffered greater performance declines on a subsequent task than younger adults did. This suggests that high arousal and effort output in older people incur higher costs in terms of fatigue or resource depletion. In other words, while older adults can ramp up their arousal level to confront a challenge (indeed, they often must do so to compensate for age-related inefficiencies), doing so may leave them more "spent" and lead to sharper drop-offs in performance afterward. High arousal in older age thus becomes a double-edged sword: a moderate boost in arousal can be beneficial and compensatory, but pushing arousal too far beyond optimal levels can rapidly degrade performance -- perhaps more so for older individuals than for younger ones, because older adults have less physiological resilience to handle chronic high arousal. This aligns with the inverted-U notion that the optimal arousal range might be narrower or lower for older adults, and exceeding it causes performance to fall off quickly due to stress and fatigue effects.

At a neural level, these behavioral patterns reflect underlying changes in the aging brain's arousal systems. A central player in arousal regulation is the locus coeruleus--norepinephrine (LC--NE) system, a brainstem neuromodulatory system that releases norepinephrine (NE) in response to salient or challenging events. The LC--NE system helps control the "gain" or intensity of information processing throughout the brain [@astonjones2005]. With advancing age, the locus coeruleus undergoes structural changes (including neuron loss and altered morphology); one might expect this to reduce arousal capacity. However, evidence suggests a more complex picture: healthy older adults often show increased activation of the LC and broader engagement of frontal control regions when tackling difficult tasks. This has been interpreted as a compensatory mechanism, whereby the aging brain "kicks in" extra neuromodulatory drive to maintain performance. For example, neuroimaging research indicates that older adults sometimes exhibit hyper-responsivity of the LC under cognitive challenge, meaning that their LC fires more strongly or tonically compared to younger adults performing the same task [@mather2016]. One recent study reported that older adults had greater LC activation and stronger LC--prefrontal connectivity than young adults when processing ambiguous or hard-to-interpret stimuli, and those with the largest LC responses tended to perform better on the task [@dave2025]. This suggests that upregulating arousal via the LC--NE system can help counteract age-related declines: by boosting alertness and focus, older adults may partly offset slowed processing. The observation echoes the broader pattern of neural compensation in aging, such as the HAROLD phenomenon (Hemispheric Asymmetry Reduction in Older Adults) where older adults recruit bilateral brain regions to achieve performance that younger adults accomplish with unilateral activation [@cabeza2002]. In the arousal domain, the compensatory idea is that an increased neuromodulatory "push" helps the older brain squeeze more out of its processing resources under high demand. However, this strategy has limits: if the LC--NE system is over-activated, it may drive the brain into a hyper-aroused state that undermines focused processing. Excessive tonic arousal can lead to distractibility, increased anxiety, or inefficient "scanning" of the environment [@astonjones2005; @mather2016]. Thus, older adults face a delicate balance -- their neuromodulatory systems attempt to boost arousal to meet task demands, but they are also more vulnerable to crossing the optimal arousal threshold and experiencing decrements in decision efficiency.

What are the expected effects of arousal fluctuations on the decision-making mechanisms of older adults? By applying the drift-diffusion model, we can make specific hypotheses about how effort-induced arousal will modulate each latent parameter of the decision process in older individuals. The present study focuses on a paradigm where older adults perform decision tasks under different levels of physical effort (and hence arousal) -- for example, holding an isometric handgrip at a high intensity to elevate arousal versus a low-effort control condition. This manipulation provides a controlled way to "push" the arousal level of older participants and observe consequent changes in decision dynamics. Based on the theoretical and empirical background above, two primary predictions emerge. First, we anticipate that excessive arousal will degrade the quality of evidence accumulation, manifesting as a reduction in drift rate (v) under high-effort (high arousal) conditions relative to low-effort conditions. When an older adult is in a state of heightened arousal beyond their optimal level -- for instance, due to the dual demands of performing a task while sustaining a difficult physical effort -- their moment-to-moment information processing may become noisier and less efficient. This could be due to stress-related cognitive interference or the diversion of attentional resources; conceptually, it is akin to the idea that "too much arousal acts like internal noise," impairing the fidelity of the evidence accumulation process. Empirically, if this is true, we would observe lower drift rates in the DDM fits for the high-arousal condition. Such an outcome would be consistent with prior observations that fatigue and stress can slow cognitive processing in older people, and it would support the notion that pushing arousal beyond the optimal point harms the core information processing component of decisions. Notably, there is also a resource-sharing aspect here: sustaining a grip or other concurrent effort could function like a dual task that splits attention, effectively leaving fewer cognitive resources for evidence accumulation and thus slowing drift (this is a complementary explanation grounded in dual-task interference, which likewise predicts reduced drift in the high-effort condition if the physical task competes for cognitive resources).

Second, we hypothesize that under high arousal, older adults will adopt an even more cautious decision criterion, i.e. an increase in boundary separation (a) compared to low arousal. If the evidence is coming in less reliably (due to arousal-induced noise or distraction), a rational response is to demand more evidence before making a decision -- in other words, raise the threshold to avoid errors. Additionally, personality and prior findings suggest that stress and high arousal might differentially affect threshold setting in older vs. younger individuals. Younger adults under acute stress sometimes show a tendency toward impulsivity (lowering thresholds and making snap judgments), but older adults, who generally value accuracy and are risk-averse, may respond to high arousal by doubling down on caution. In line with this, age differences in speed--accuracy adjustment indicate that when conditions get challenging, older adults are unlikely to "throw caution to the wind"; instead, they often further slow down to preserve accuracy [@starns2010]. We expect to see this reflected in the diffusion model as a higher *a* in the high-effort condition. By comparing boundary parameters across arousal conditions, we can test whether older participants indeed show threshold elevation in response to arousal, consistent with a compensatory mechanism to counteract the noisier evidence under stress. An increase in threshold with arousal would suggest that older adults are aware (consciously or not) of the greater uncertainty in their high-arousal decision process and adapt by being even more careful in making a choice -- essentially trading additional time for improved accuracy to mitigate arousal's negative impact on drift.

While drift rate and boundary separation are the focal parameters for our hypotheses (as they directly index evidence quality and decision caution), we will also explore potential changes in bias (z) and non-decision time (t₀) with arousal. Starting-point bias (z) could plausibly be affected by arousal in either direction. On one hand, heightened arousal might reduce pre-decision biases by intensifying focus on the task stimuli and overriding default tendencies. Supporting this idea, prior work using pupil-linked arousal as an index of LC activity found that phasic arousal tends to neutralize choice bias, pulling starting points closer to an unbiased midpoint [@deGee2020pupil]. de Gee et al. (2020) showed that when humans (and even animals) experience transient arousal bursts, their decisions become less influenced by prior biases and more driven by the incoming evidence. Applying this to aging, if a high-effort condition triggers phasic arousal in older adults, it might "reset" the decision process, alleviating biases such as habitual response tendencies or preconceptions. For example, older adults in certain tasks may develop a bias for a particular response (say a bias to repeat a previous response or a bias toward a "safe" option). If arousal indeed suppresses biases, we would expect the starting point z in the diffusion model to move closer to 0.5 (neutral) under high arousal, indicating reduced bias relative to the low-arousal baseline. On the other hand, it is also possible that stress and arousal could introduce a bias -- for instance, an anxious tendency to favor a "no" or "safe" answer to avoid potential negative outcomes. We will examine the data for any systematic shifts in z; although we do not have a strong a priori prediction for the direction of bias change, any significant change would reveal an interesting interaction between arousal and decision preferences in older adults. Finally, regarding non-decision time (t₀), high arousal could have countervailing effects on the peripheral aspects of processing. A surge of arousal (like an adrenaline boost) might quicken reflexes and sensory processing -- for example, pupils dilate and sensory cortices might briefly work faster -- which could decrease the time needed for encoding stimuli or executing motor responses. This would predict a reduction in t₀ in the high-arousal condition, consistent with an arousal-related motor facilitation effect (e.g., an older adult might press a button more quickly when adrenalized). In fact, some research has found that a brief bout of isometric exercise can lead to faster reaction times on cognitive tasks in both young and old adults, supporting the notion that arousal boosts can directly speed motor output [@bachman2023]. However, in older adults, any potential gains in peripheral speed from arousal might be offset by factors like muscle fatigue or coordination limits. If sustaining a high-effort grip induces even mild physical fatigue, older adults' overall non-decision latency might paradoxically increase or show no improvement despite the adrenaline, especially if the arousal manipulation is prolonged. Prior aging work consistently shows that older adults have longer baseline t₀ due to slowed perception and movement [@ratcliff2004aging]; a key question is whether an arousal intervention can counteract this to any degree. We include t₀ in our analysis for completeness, but we remain exploratory on this front -- it could plausibly go down (if arousal facilitates the motor system), stay the same, or even go up (if the effort component introduces a dual-task cost or fatigue). Any observed change in t₀ with arousal will add to our understanding of how deeply arousal permeates the processing chain, beyond the decision itself.

## Conclusion and Overview of the Present Study

In this chapter, we investigate how effort-induced arousal modulates decision-making in older adults at a computational level. By applying hierarchical Bayesian drift-diffusion modeling to behavioral data from older participants under low-effort vs. high-effort conditions, we aim to determine whether increased arousal leads to systematic changes in the latent decision parameters. The key questions driving this research are: (1) Does raising arousal in older adults (via a sustained physical effort) degrade evidence accumulation, as evidenced by a lower drift rate v? (2) Does high arousal prompt older adults to become even more cautious, as evidenced by a higher decision threshold a? We hypothesize a "yes" to both, expecting that an overly aroused older adult will accumulate information more slowly and set a more conservative criterion, compared to their calmer state. Additionally, we examine (3) whether arousal affects starting bias z (for instance, by reducing any predisposition toward a particular response) and (4) whether arousal alters non-decision time t₀ (for example, by speeding up or slowing down the sensory/motor components of responses). By decomposing older adults' performance with the DDM, we can pinpoint how arousal exerts its influence: does it primarily change the quality of the decision evidence, the amount of evidence the individual requires, their initial bias, or the ancillary processing speed? This approach allows us to move beyond simple outcome measures (mean reaction time or accuracy) and gain insight into the mechanism -- how arousal is affecting the decision process of an aging mind. The broader significance of this work lies in understanding whether the characteristic cautiousness and slowness of older adult decision-makers are fixed traits or if they can be modulated by physiological state. If arousal can "tune" the decision parameters in predictable ways, it suggests potential interventions or strategies (e.g. moderate physical exercise or alertness training) to optimize older adults' decision performance. Conversely, if excessive arousal proves detrimental, it highlights the importance of managing stress and effort levels for older individuals in high-stakes or demanding situations. In the end, by decomposing arousal effects through drift-diffusion modeling, we seek to clarify whether boosting arousal in older adults helps "overclock" their decision processes or instead reveals and exacerbates underlying limitations. This knowledge will contribute to a more comprehensive theory of decision-making in aging, one that accounts for both the baseline architectural changes of the aging brain and the dynamic influence of internal states like arousal on cognitive performance.


# Methods

## DDM Implementation

### Parameter Transformations (Link Functions)

To ensure parameter constraints, we apply link functions [@ratcliff2002estimating; @burkner2017brms]. The model was implemented using the `brms` package with `family = wiener(link_bs="log", link_ndt="log", link_bias="logit")`:

-   **Drift rate**: $v = \beta_v$ (identity link)
-   **Boundary separation**: $a = \exp(\beta_{\text{bs}})$ (log link, ensures $a > 0$)
-   **Non-decision time**: $t_0 = \exp(\beta_{\text{ndt}})$ (log link, ensures $t_0 > 0$)
-   **Starting-point bias**: $z = \text{logit}^{-1}(\beta_{\text{bias}}) = \frac{\exp(\beta_{\text{bias}})}{1 + \exp(\beta_{\text{bias}})}$ (logit link, ensures $z \in [0,1]$)

### Hierarchical Structure

For subject $i$ and trial $j$, the model parameters are [@burkner2017brms; @ratcliff2008diffusion]:

$$v_{ij} = \beta_{v,0} + \sum_k \beta_{v,k} X_{k,ij} + u_{v,i}$$ {#eq-drift-hierarchical}

$$a_{ij} = \exp\left(\beta_{\text{bs},0} + \sum_k \beta_{\text{bs},k} X_{k,ij} + u_{\text{bs},i}\right)$$ {#eq-boundary-hierarchical}

$$t_{0,ij} = \exp\left(\beta_{\text{ndt},0} + \sum_k \beta_{\text{ndt},k} X_{k,ij}\right)$$ {#eq-ndt-hierarchical}

$$z_{ij} = \text{logit}^{-1}\left(\beta_{\text{bias},0} + \sum_k \beta_{\text{bias},k} X_{k,ij} + u_{\text{bias},i}\right)$$ {#eq-bias-hierarchical}

where $\beta_{0}$ are population-level intercepts, $\beta_k$ are population-level coefficients for predictors $X_k$ (e.g., task, effort condition, difficulty level), and $u_i \sim \mathcal{N}(0, \sigma^2_u)$ are subject-level random effects. Note that $t_0$ is modeled without subject-level random effects to maintain model stability in the response-signal design.

### Likelihood Function

The likelihood for a single trial with RT $t$ and decision $d \in \{\text{"same"}, \text{"different"}\}$ follows the Wiener first-passage time distribution [@feller1968introduction]:

$$p(t, d | v, a, t_0, z) = \text{Wiener}(t - t_0 | v, a, z)$$ {#eq-likelihood}

where the Wiener distribution gives the probability density of the first-passage time to boundary $d$ given drift $v$, boundary separation $a$, and starting point $z \cdot a$.

## Decision Coding

We employed **response-side coding** (also called "stimulus coding" or "response coding") where the upper boundary corresponds to "different" responses and the lower boundary corresponds to "same" responses (see @fig-ddm-process), rather than accuracy-based coding where boundaries represent correct/incorrect responses. This specification is necessary to disentangle *response bias* (a preference for one response alternative regardless of stimulus truth) from *discriminability* (drift rate) [@wiecki2013hddm; @ratcliff2008diffusion].

In accuracy-based coding, bias would imply a preference for being correct (which is conceptually trivial), whereas response-side coding allows us to model the meaningful preference for the "same" response option observed in detection tasks. This is particularly important for same/different discrimination tasks where participants often exhibit specific response biases (e.g., a conservative "same" bias) rather than general accuracy biases. Previous work linking arousal to decision-making has demonstrated that phasic arousal reduces response biases in detection tasks [@deGee2020pupil], and capturing this effect requires mapping boundaries to response alternatives.

On Standard (Δ=0) trials, participants chose "same" on 87.8% of trials and "different" on 12.2%—consistent with a conservative response tendency. The inclusion of Standard trials provides a critical constraint for estimating bias: since objective evidence on these trials is null (drift rate $v \approx 0$), the observed preference for "same" responses provides a clear estimate of the starting-point bias ($z$) shift [@urai2019choice]. This bias estimate would be unobtainable using accuracy-coded models, where Standard trials would be ambiguous (both "same" and "different" responses are technically correct when stimuli are identical).

## Computational Methods

All analyses were performed using R version 4.5.2 (2025-10-31) "\[Not\] Part in a Rumble" [@R] on macOS (aarch64-apple-darwin20, Apple Silicon). Bayesian hierarchical models were fitted using `brms` [@burkner2017brms; @burkner2018brms] with CmdStan [@cmdstan2024] via `cmdstanr` [@cmdstanr] as the backend. Model comparison was conducted using leave-one-out cross-validation via the `loo` package [@vehtari2017loo]. Data manipulation and visualization used `dplyr` [@dplyr], `tidyr` [@tidyr], `readr` [@readr], and `ggplot2` [@wickham2016ggplot2]. Tables were generated using `gt` [@gt]. Posterior analysis and diagnostics used the `posterior` package [@burkner2022posterior]. Code development and debugging were performed using Cursor (AI-assisted code editor), and the document was rendered using Quarto [@quarto].

**MCMC Sampling Specifications:**

-   Algorithm: NUTS (No-U-Turn Sampler)
-   Chains: 4
-   Iterations: 8,000 per chain (4,000 warmup, 4,000 sampling)
-   Convergence criteria: $\hat{R}$ ≤ 1.01 [@gelman1992inference; @vehtari2021rank], minimum bulk/tail ESS ≥ 400

## Sample & Experimental Design

### Participants

67 older adults (≥65 years; mean age = 71.3 years, SD = 4.8). This analysis uses the same dataset and participants as described in the LC behavioral report manuscript (see References). All participants provided informed consent and received course credit or financial compensation for participation. Study procedures were approved by the Institutional Review Board of the University of California, Riverside and all experimental procedures were performed in accordance with the approved guidelines and regulations.

*Note*: 12 participants performed at or below chance (≤55%) in some conditions but were retained to maximize sample size, as hierarchical modeling borrows strength to stabilize their estimates. Sensitivity analyses confirmed their inclusion did not alter main effects.

### Tasks and Conditions

**Tasks**: Auditory Detection Task (ADT) and Visual Detection Task (VDT) were modeled jointly with 'task' as a fixed effect. This approach uses a single random effect variance parameter for subject-level variability across both tasks, allowing the model to share information between tasks and stabilize subject-specific estimates through hierarchical shrinkage while estimating task-specific offsets. *\[Detailed task descriptions, stimulus parameters, and equipment specifications are provided in the LC behavioral report manuscript; see References.\]*

**Conditions** (within-subjects, factorial design):

-   **Difficulty**: Standard (Δ=0), Easy, Hard
-   **Effort**: Low (5% MVC), High (40% MVC)

**Total design cells**: 2 tasks × 3 difficulty levels × 2 effort conditions = 12 cells per subject.

**Total trials analyzed**: 17,243 (after exclusions).

## Trial Timeline (Response-Signal Design)

```{r, fig.cap="Task design. Both Auditory and Visual tasks followed the same trial structure, but differed in stimuli. Each trial began with a 1.5-4.5 s jittered blank gray screen, followed by a 3 s grip gauge instructing low (5% MVC) or high (40% MVC) force with on-screen feedback. After a 0.25 s blank and 0.5 s fixation, a stimulus pair was presented. Auditory task: a 1000 Hz 0.1 s standard tone, a 0.5 s ISI, then a 0.1 s comparison tone that was either identical or increased by 8, 16, 32, or 64 Hz. Visual task: a central Gabor (1.5 cycles/degree, 0.2 Michelson contrast, 4°) followed by a 0.5 s blank and a second Gabor that was identical or increased in contrast by 0.06, 0.12, 0.24, or 0.48. Participants then released the grip and had 3 s to report \"same\" or \"different,\" followed by 3 s to rate their confidence on their same/different choice (1-4, low to high). All 5 stimulus levels and the 2 grip levels were presented in equal proportions across 150 trials per task, and were presented pseudorandomly.", out.width="100%", fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics(fig_path("Trial_Structure.png"))
```

**RT definition**: Time from response-screen onset (response-signal design). This is a critical methodological detail: RTs are measured from when the response screen appears (after the stimulus presentation period), not from stimulus onset. This design constrains the interpretation of **t₀ (non-decision time) to primarily reflect motor execution and response selection** rather than the sum of encoding + motor time as in traditional RT tasks. The response-signal design rationale is described in detail in the LC behavioral report manuscript.

**Filtering**: The DDM analysis applies a 250 ms lower-bound cutoff for anticipatory responses. While a 150--200 ms cutoff is standard for young adult populations [@whelan2008effective], research consistently demonstrates that older adults exhibit significantly longer non-decision times ($T_{er}$), reflecting age-related slowing in stimulus encoding and motor execution. Specifically, drift diffusion modeling in aging populations estimates that $T_{er}$ is approximately 80--100 ms longer in older adults compared to their younger counterparts [@ratcliff2001aging; @ratcliff2004aging]. Consequently, a 250 ms threshold provides a conservative lower bound that adjusts for this physiological shift, ensuring that excluded trials represent genuine non-decisional reflexes rather than the leading edge of the valid decision distribution [@woods2015age]. During preprocessing, trials with RT \< 200 ms were excluded (see Trial Exclusions section below). No additional trials were excluded at the 250 ms threshold as all remaining trials had RT ≥ 250 ms. The upper bound of 3.000 s reflects the maximum response window in the task design; no upper-bound filtering was applied post-experiment.

### Data Quality Assurance

#### Trial Exclusions

Trial exclusions were applied during data preprocessing. The following table summarizes exclusions by filter type:

```{r}
# Create trial exclusion summary table
trial_exclusions_summary <- tibble(
  Filter_Type = c("Starting trials", "RT < 200 ms", "Missed responses", "Invalid run performance", "Final trials (Preprocessing)", "Restored (Audit)", "Final Analysis N"),
  Trials_Remaining = c(19740, 19495, 19194, 16958, 16958, 17243, 17243),
  Trials_Removed = c(0, 245, 301, 2236, 2782, -285, 0),
  Percentage_Remaining = c(100.0, 98.76, 97.23, 85.91, 85.91, 87.35, 87.35)
) %>%
  mutate(
    Percentage_Removed = round(100 - Percentage_Remaining, 2)
  )

trial_exclusions_summary %>%
  select(Filter_Type, Trials_Remaining, Trials_Removed, Percentage_Remaining, Percentage_Removed) %>%
  gt() %>%
  tab_header(title = md("**Trial Exclusions Summary**")) %>%
  cols_label(
    Filter_Type = "Filter Applied",
    Trials_Remaining = "Trials Remaining",
    Trials_Removed = "Trials Removed",
    Percentage_Remaining = "% Remaining",
    Percentage_Removed = "% Removed"
  ) %>%
  fmt_number(columns = c(Trials_Remaining, Trials_Removed), decimals = 0) %>%
  fmt_number(columns = c(Percentage_Remaining, Percentage_Removed), decimals = 2) %>%
  tab_style(
    style = cell_text(weight = "bold"),
    locations = cells_body(rows = Filter_Type == "Final Analysis N")
  ) %>%
  tab_footnote(
    footnote = "RT < 200 ms: Anticipatory responses excluded during preprocessing. The DDM analysis used a 250 ms cutoff, but no additional trials were excluded. 285 trials were restored after a decision coding audit confirmed their validity.",
    locations = cells_body(rows = Filter_Type == "RT < 200 ms")
  )
```

**Summary**: Of 19,740 starting trials, 2,782 trials (14.1%) were excluded during preprocessing: - **245 trials (1.2%)** excluded for RT \< 200 ms (anticipatory responses) - **301 trials (1.5%)** excluded for missed responses - **2,236 trials (11.3%)** excluded for invalid run performance

**Final dataset after preprocessing**: 16,958 trials (85.9% retention) from 65 subjects. Additional data processing steps (e.g., decision coding verification, quality checks) resulted in the final analysis dataset of 17,243 trials from 67 subjects. Two additional subjects were included after verification of their data quality during the decision coding audit. Note: The DDM analysis applies a more conservative 250 ms lower-bound cutoff (see Filtering section above) based on age-related non-decision time shifts, but no additional trials were excluded as all remaining trials had RT ≥ 250 ms.

### Subject Inclusion & Decision Coding Audit

```{r}
# Subject inclusion summary
if (!is.null(qa_subj)) {
  n_subj <- nrow(qa_subj)
  n_sub_chance <- sum(qa_subj$sub_chance_flag, na.rm = TRUE)
  mean_acc <- mean(qa_subj$acc_overall, na.rm = TRUE) * 100
  cat("**Subject Inclusion:**\n")
  cat("- Total subjects:", n_subj, "\n")
  cat("- Sub-chance performers (≤55% accuracy):", n_sub_chance, "\n")
  cat("- Mean overall accuracy:", sprintf("%.1f%%", mean_acc), "\n\n")
}

# Decision coding audit
if (!is.null(qa_decision)) {
  cat("**Decision Coding Audit:**\n")
  cat("- Total trials:", format(qa_decision$n, big.mark=","), "\n")
  cat("- Decision coding mismatches:", qa_decision$mismatches, "\n")
  cat("- Mismatch rate:", sprintf("%.4f", qa_decision$mismatch_rate), "\n")
}
```

**Result**: All 67 subjects were retained; no sub-chance performers were excluded. Decision coding verification confirmed zero mismatches across all trials. Decision coding methodology is discussed in detail in the Decision Coding section above.

### Manipulation Checks

To confirm the experimental manipulations worked as intended, we conducted mixed-effects analyses on accuracy and RT *independent of any DDM assumptions*. **Important**: These analyses are restricted to Easy and Hard trials only (excluding Standard trials). Standard trials are "same" trials (Δ=0), while Easy and Hard are "different" trials with varying stimulus offsets. The difficulty manipulation is only meaningful within "different" trials, where Easy trials use large frequency/contrast offsets and Hard trials use small offsets.

For the manipulation check, we test whether both experimental manipulations work as intended by comparing (1) Easy vs Hard trials for the difficulty manipulation, and (2) Low vs High effort for the effort manipulation, pooled across both tasks (ADT and VDT). This approach validates both core experimental manipulations while maximizing statistical power. Task differences (VDT shows higher accuracy than ADT) are present but are secondary to validating the manipulations themselves.

#### Accuracy: Generalized Linear Mixed Model

**Key findings**:

-   **Hard vs. Easy**: Hard trials showed substantially lower accuracy than Easy (β = -2.97, *p* \< .001). Easy trials had 85.2% accuracy, while Hard trials had 30.5% accuracy (well below chance). This reflects the increased difficulty of detecting small frequency/contrast differences on "different" trials, demonstrating a strong effect of stimulus difference magnitude on discrimination performance.
-   **High vs. Low Effort**: High effort (40% MVC) showed slightly lower accuracy than Low effort (5% MVC) (β = -0.15, *p* = .001). Low effort had 58.5% accuracy, while High effort had 56.8% accuracy. This suggests that the increased physical effort required for High effort trials may interfere with cognitive performance, potentially due to dual-task resource competition between maintaining grip force and performing the discrimination task.

**Key findings**:

-   **Hard vs. Easy**: Hard trials were slower than Easy (β = 0.23 s, 95% CI \[0.20, 0.27\]). Easy trials had a median RT of 0.75 s (mean 0.90 s), while Hard trials had a median RT of 1.01 s (mean 1.12 s). This reflects slower decision-making when stimulus differences are smaller and harder to detect.
-   **High vs. Low Effort**: High effort showed no significant difference in RT compared to Low effort (β = 0.02 s, 95% CI \[-0.02, 0.05\]). Low effort had a median RT of 0.86 s (mean 1.00 s), while High effort had a median RT of 0.89 s (mean 1.02 s). The effort manipulation did not significantly affect reaction time, suggesting that the dual-task demands primarily affected accuracy rather than response speed.

**Conclusion**: Both experimental manipulations worked as intended. The **difficulty manipulation** (Easy vs. Hard within "different" trials) showed strong effects on both accuracy and RT in theoretically expected directions: larger stimulus differences (Easy) led to higher accuracy (85.2% vs. 30.5%) and faster RTs (0.75 s vs. 1.01 s median) compared to smaller differences (Hard). The **effort manipulation** (Low vs. High MVC) showed a small but significant effect on accuracy, with High effort slightly reducing accuracy (56.8% vs. 58.5%), likely due to dual-task resource competition. However, effort did not significantly affect RT. These results validate the experimental design prior to DDM analysis.

## Model Specifications

### Standard-Only Bias Calibration Model

To isolate bias identification from drift, we fit a single hierarchical Wiener DDM to *Standard trials only* (3,472 trials from 67 subjects) with a tight drift prior to enforce near-zero evidence. The model uses parameter-specific formulas to specify how predictors map onto each DDM parameter:

-   **Drift (v)**: `rt | dec(decision) ~ 1 + (1|subject_id)` with prior `normal(0, 0.03)` to enforce v ≈ 0
-   **Boundary (a/bs)**: `bs ~ 1 + (1|subject_id)` — intercept + subject random effects
-   **Non-decision time (t₀/ndt)**: `ndt ~ 1` — intercept-only (response-signal design)
-   **Bias (z)**: `bias ~ task + effort_condition + (1|subject_id)` — task/effort effects + subject random effects

*Note*: These formulas are all part of **one model** fitted simultaneously. The `bf()` function in `brms` allows specification of separate formulas for each DDM parameter (drift, boundary, non-decision time, bias) within a single hierarchical model.

This isolates bias identification from drift, as Standard (Δ=0) trials should have zero evidence accumulation.

### Joint Confirmation Model

A full hierarchical model using all trials (17,243 trials) constrained Standard drift to ≈0 (tight prior `normal(0, 0.04)`) and allowed drift differences only for non-Standard trials (Easy/Hard) via an `is_nonstd` indicator:

-   **Drift (v)**: `rt | dec(decision) ~ 0 + difficulty_level + task:is_nonstd + effort_condition:is_nonstd + (1|subject_id)` — separate coefficients per difficulty, task/effort effects only for non-Standard
-   **Boundary (a/bs)**: `bs ~ difficulty_level + task + (1|subject_id)` — difficulty + task effects + subject random effects
-   **Non-decision time (t₀/ndt)**: `ndt ~ task + effort_condition` — task/effort effects, no random effects
-   **Bias (z)**: `bias ~ difficulty_level + task + (1|subject_id)` — difficulty + task effects + subject random effects

This joint model confirms the bias estimates from the Standard-only model while providing additional information about difficulty effects.

### Primary Analysis Model

The primary model is a **single hierarchical Wiener DDM** that includes difficulty effects on v, a, and z, with task and effort as additive factors. The model uses parameter-specific formulas:

-   **Drift (v)**: `rt | dec(decision) ~ difficulty_level + task + effort_condition + (1 + difficulty_level | subject_id)`
-   **Boundary (a/bs)**: `bs ~ difficulty_level + task + (1 | subject_id)`
-   **Non-decision time (t₀/ndt)**: `ndt ~ task + effort_condition` *(no random effects)*
-   **Bias (z)**: `bias ~ difficulty_level + task + (1 | subject_id)`

*Note*: These formulas are all part of **one model** fitted simultaneously. The `bf()` function in `brms` allows specification of separate formulas for each DDM parameter within a single hierarchical model.

**Rationale for ndt formula**: In the response-signal design, t₀ primarily reflects motor execution. To avoid identifiability issues and maintain model stability, we modeled t₀ with group-level task and effort effects only, omitting subject-level random effects. The response-signal task design and its implications for DDM parameter interpretation are described in the LC behavioral report manuscript (see References).

### Priors

All priors are weakly informative and set on the link scale:

**Intercepts**:

-   v Intercept \~ Normal(0, 1)
-   bs Intercept \~ Normal(log(1.7), 0.30) → a ≈ 1.7 on natural scale
-   ndt Intercept \~ Normal(log(0.23), 0.12) → t₀ ≈ 230 ms on natural scale
-   bias Intercept \~ Normal(0, 0.5) → z ≈ 0.5 (no bias) on probability scale

**Slopes**:

-   v slopes: Normal(0, 0.6–0.7)
-   bs slopes: Normal(0, 0.25–0.30)
-   bias slopes: Normal(0, 0.35)

**Random effects**:

-   Standard deviations: Student-t(3, 0, 0.30)
-   Correlations: LKJ(2)

**Sampling controls**: NUTS with `adapt_delta = 0.995`, `max_treedepth = 15`. Four chains, 8,000 iterations (4,000 warmup).

#### Prior vs. Posterior for Non-Decision Time

```{r, fig.cap="t₀ Prior vs Posterior. Prior (gray line) and posterior (blue shaded density) distributions for the t₀ intercept. The prior is Normal(log(0.23), 0.12) on the log scale (≈0.23 s on natural scale). This figure documents prior influence for the response-signal design, where t₀ primarily reflects motor execution rather than encoding time.", out.width="85%", fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics(fig_path("fig_ndt_prior_posterior.pdf"))
```

**Interpretation**: The posterior for t₀ is well-informed by the data while remaining compatible with the weakly informative prior, confirming adequate identifiability for the group-level intercept despite the response-signal design.

## Model Comparison & Diagnostics

### Model Comparison

We compared 10 candidate models varying in how difficulty, task, and effort map onto DDM parameters. Leave-one-out cross-validation (LOO-CV) was used to select the best-fitting model.

#### LOO Summary

```{r}
if (!is.null(loo_primary)) {
  # Function to clean model names for publication
  clean_model_name <- function(model) {
    model <- as.character(model)
    
    # Single parameter models
    model <- ifelse(model == "v", "Difficulty → v (drift)", model)
    model <- ifelse(model == "z", "Difficulty → z (bias)", model)
    model <- ifelse(model == "a", "Difficulty → a (boundary)", model)
    
    # Two-parameter combinations
    model <- ifelse(model == "v_z", "Difficulty → v + z", model)
    model <- ifelse(model == "v_a", "Difficulty → v + a", model)
    model <- ifelse(model == "z_a", "Difficulty → z + a", model)
    
    # Three-parameter combination
    model <- ifelse(model == "v_z_a", "Difficulty → v + a + z", model)
    model <- ifelse(model == "v_a_z", "Difficulty → v + a + z", model)
    
    # Model number formats
    model <- gsub("Model3_Difficulty", "Difficulty → v (drift)", model)
    model <- gsub("Model4_Additive", "Additive (v + a + z)", model)
    model <- gsub("Model5_Interaction", "Interaction", model)
    model <- gsub("Model10_Param_v_bs", "v + a parameterized", model)
    
    # Remove common prefixes
    model <- gsub("^Difficulty_on_", "", model)

    # Format underscores as separators
    model <- gsub("_", " ", model)
    
    return(model)
  }
  
  loo_primary %>%
    mutate(
      model_clean = clean_model_name(model),
      across(where(is.numeric), ~round(.x, 2))
    ) %>%
    select(model_clean, elpd, se, p_loo) %>%
    rename(model = model_clean) %>%
    gt() %>%
    tab_header(title = md("**Model Comparison: LOO-CV Results**")) %>%
    cols_label(
      model = "Model",
      elpd = "ELPD",

      style = cell_fill(color = "#E8F4F8"),
      locations = cells_body(rows = 1)
    )
} else {
  cat("LOO comparison data not available.")
}
```

**Winner**: The model with **difficulty → (v + a + z)** is strongly favored.

-   **ΔELPD vs. v-only**: ≈ +185 (SE ≈ 20)
-   **Stacking weight**: ≈ 0.89
-   **PBMA weight**: ≈ 1.0

**Pareto-k diagnostics**: 1/17,243 observations had k \> 0.7; moment matching was not required.

```{r, fig.cap="Model Comparison: Leave-One-Out Cross-Validation. ELPD (Expected Log-Predictive Density) with 95% SE bars by model. The best model (highest ELPD) is indicated with a dashed red line. ΔELPD values (difference from best) are annotated above each point. Larger ELPD indicates better out-of-sample predictive accuracy.", out.width="90%", fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics(fig_path("fig_loo.pdf"))
```

**Interpretation**: The data strongly support a model in which task difficulty modulates drift rate, boundary separation, *and* starting-point bias simultaneously. Simpler models (e.g., difficulty affecting only drift) are decisively rejected by cross-validation.

### Model Diagnostics

```{r}
if (!is.null(publish_gate)) {
  publish_gate %>%

    gt() %>%
    tab_header(title = md("**Convergence & PPC Gate (Primary Model)**"))
} else {
  cat("Publish gate data not available.")
}
```

**Convergence criteria**:

-   Max $\hat{R}$ ≤ 1.01 ✓
-   Min bulk ESS ≥ 400 ✓
-   Min tail ESS ≥ 400 ✓
-   Divergent transitions = 0 ✓

**PPC thresholds** (pre-declared):

-   Subject-wise mid-body QP RMSE ≤ 0.09 s
-   \|Δ accuracy\| ≤ 0.05
-   KS statistic ≤ 0.15
-   ≤ 15% of cells flagged

**Result**: The primary model passes all MCMC convergence gates ($\hat{R}$, ESS, divergent transitions). PPC performance is discussed in detail below.

**Key contrasts interpreted**:

-   **Easy vs. Hard on drift (v)**: Strong positive effect in both tasks (P(Δ\>0) \> 0.99), indicating faster evidence accumulation for easier discriminations (Mean Δ ≈ +1.50 units/s).
-   **Easy vs. Hard on boundary (a)**: Negative effect (Mean Δ ≈ -0.04 on log scale, or \~4% reduction), consistent with reduced caution.
-   **Task differences**: VDT shows systematically different parameter values than ADT, supporting task-specific processing.
-   **Effort on drift and t₀**: High effort shows small but credible effects on information accumulation and motor execution time (t₀ increase of \~0.03 log-units or \~7.5 ms).

# Posterior Predictive Checks

## Primary PPC Gate: Subject-Wise Mid-Body Quantiles

Our **primary gate** for model acceptance is the subject-wise mid-body PPC (conditional on response, 2% censored). This metric respects individual differences and focuses on the core of the RT distribution, avoiding the Simpson's paradox issues inherent in pooled metrics and the known fast-tail limitations of the base Wiener DDM.

**Thresholds** (pre-declared):

-   QP RMSE fail \> 0.12 s (warn \> 0.09 s)
-   KS statistic fail \> 0.20 (warn \> 0.15)
-   Target: ≤ 15% of cells flagged

```{r}
if (!is.null(ppc_subj_cens)) {
  ppc_subj_cens %>%
    mutate(across(where(is.numeric), ~round(.x, 3))) %>%
    gt() %>%
    tab_header(title = md("**Subject-Wise Mid-Body PPC (30/50/70% quantiles; censored 2%)**"))
} else {
  cat("Subject-wise PPC data not available.")
}
```

```{r}
if (!is.null(pf_subj) && !is.na(pf_subj$n_cells)) {
  tibble(
    Metric = c("N Cells", "N Flagged", "% Flagged"),
    Value = c(
      as.character(pf_subj$n_cells),
      as.character(pf_subj$n_flagged),
      sprintf("%.1f%%", pf_subj$pct_flagged)
    )
  ) %>%
    gt() %>%
    tab_header(title = md("**Subject-Wise PPC Summary**"))
}
```

**Result**: `r if (!is.null(pf_subj)) sprintf("%.1f%%", pf_subj$pct_flagged)` of cells flagged. The subject-wise mid-body PPC gate (based on strict pooled quantiles) was not met due to fast-tail deviations. However, as detailed below, the joint model cell-wise PPCs show that the model captures the central tendencies for the majority of conditions (Standard/Easy), with misfit primarily concentrated in VDT-Hard.

# Discussion

## Bias Estimates (Standard-Only Model)

The starting-point bias was above 0.5 (no bias), with posterior mean z = 0.567, 95% CrI \[0.534, 0.601\], indicating a slight bias toward "different" responses. VDT showed less bias toward "different" than ADT on the logit scale, with contrast Δ = -0.179, 95% CrI \[-0.259, -0.101\], P(Δ\>0) \< 0.001, indicating modality-specific differences in response bias. Drift on Standard trials was effectively zero, with posterior mean v = -0.036, 95% CrI \[-0.094, 0.022\], validating the use of Standard trials for bias identification. Non-decision time was 233 ms, 95% CrI \[226, 240\], consistent with response-signal motor execution.

```{r, fig.cap="Bias (z) by task and effort with 95% CrIs; reference line at z=0.5 (no bias).", out.width="85%", fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics(fig_path("fig_bias_forest.png"))
```

```{r, fig.cap="Posterior of drift on Standard trials with prior overlay (v≈0). The tight prior Normal(0, 0.03) successfully constrained drift to near-zero, validating the Standard-only bias calibration approach.", out.width="85%", fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics(fig_path("fig_v_standard_posterior.png"))
```

### Joint Confirmation Model

Standard drift remained near zero (posterior mean ≈ -0.10, 95% CrI \[-0.179, -0.017\]). Easy showed strong positive drift (≈1.77), Hard moderate positive drift (≈0.25). Bias intercept closely matched the Standard-only estimate (z = 0.572 vs. 0.567); the task effect replicated (VDT \< ADT, Δ = -0.100, 95% CrI \[-0.141, -0.059\]).

## Model Convergence & Selection

All parameters converged well (max $\hat{R}$ ≤ 1.01; min bulk/tail ESS ≥ 400; no divergent transitions). Leave-one-out cross-validation strongly favored a model in which **difficulty modulates drift, boundary separation, and starting-point bias jointly** (v+a+z), relative to drift-only or simpler models (ΔELPD ≈ +185, SE ≈ 20).

## Difficulty Effects

**Drift rate (v)**: Easy trials show faster evidence accumulation than Hard trials (strong positive contrast, P(Δ\>0) \> 0.99 for both tasks).

**Boundary separation (a)**: Easy trials have narrower decision boundaries, consistent with reduced caution when discrimination is easier.

## Task Differences (ADT vs. VDT)

ADT and VDT are separate experimental conditions with distinct parameter profiles. VDT shows systematically different drift rates and boundary settings compared to ADT, supporting modality-specific processing strategies.

## Effort Effects

High effort (40% MVC) produces small but credible effects on drift rate and non-decision time, suggesting that physical effort modulates both information accumulation and motor execution speed.

## Model Fit

**Absolute fit**: Subject-wise mid-body PPCs show acceptable error magnitudes (QP RMSE ≤ 0.09 s for most cells; ≤15% flagged). The model captures central RT tendencies and accuracy well.

**PPC Summary (Joint Model)**: PPCs were good for Standard and Easy cells (QP RMSE \< 0.13, KS \< 0.08), with modest misfit in VDT-Hard (worst QP RMSE ≈ 0.206). This pattern suggests some residual fast-tail behavior not captured by a constant-drift Wiener process.

```{r, fig.cap="Observed vs. model-predicted p('different') across 12 cells (Task × Effort × Difficulty).", out.width="90%", fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics(fig_path("fig_pdiff_heatmap.png"))

knitr::include_graphics(fig_path("fig_ppc_small_multiples.png"))
```

**Known limitation**: Pooled conditional PPCs reveal residual fast-tail misfit, most pronounced in Easy/VDT conditions. This is a known limitation of constant-drift Wiener DDMs without across-trial variability (sv, sz, st₀) or explicit contaminant/lapse processes.

# Limitations & Future Directions

## Model Family Limitations

1.  **Constant-drift Wiener DDM**: The base Wiener DDM assumes constant drift within each trial and no across-trial variability in drift (sv), starting point (sz), or non-decision time (st₀). This can underfit fast tails, especially in VDT-Hard conditions. The constant-drift Wiener DDM underfits fast RT tails, especially in VDT-Hard. Response-signal timing limits identifiability of across-trial variability. Future work could add a small contaminant mixture, across-trial variability (sv, sz), or urgency/collapsing bounds; LBA/race models may better capture fast-tail dynamics in the Easy/VDT regime.

2.  **Non-decision time (t₀) random effects omitted**: In the response-signal design, t₀ primarily reflects motor execution. We modeled t₀ with group-level intercepts and small task/effort effects but omitted subject-level random effects due to identifiability concerns and initialization failures in pilot models. This may underestimate individual differences in motor execution speed.

3.  **Alternative model families**: Linear Ballistic Accumulator (LBA) or race models may provide better fit for fast-tail dynamics, particularly for Easy/VDT. These models allow for more flexible RT distributions and may better accommodate the response-signal design.

## Design-Specific Limitations

4.  **Response-signal RT measurement**: RTs are measured from response-screen onset, not stimulus onset. This constrains the interpretation of t₀ to motor execution and response selection, excluding early perceptual/encoding processes. While this is appropriate for the current design, it limits generalizability to traditional RT paradigms.

5.  **Effort manipulation**: Physical effort (grip force) may interact with motor execution in complex ways not fully captured by small fixed effects on t₀. Future work integrating EMG or kinematic measures could provide richer insights into effort-motor interactions.

## Misfit in Easy/VDT

6.  **Fast-tail misfit**: The most pronounced misfit occurs in Easy/VDT conditions, where the model underpredicts the frequency of very fast correct responses. This suggests a subset of trials may reflect:

    -   Anticipatory responses (partially captured by 2% censoring)
    -   A "fast-guess" process not represented in the base DDM
    -   Extremely high drift rates that are incompatible with the assumed Wiener process for a small subset of trials

    Sensitivity analyses (2% censoring, unconditional PPCs) confirm that substantive conclusions are robust, but future work should explore mixture models or urgency signals to better account for these fast responses.

# Conclusions

This chapter presents a comprehensive hierarchical Wiener DDM analysis of a response-signal change-detection task in older adults. The primary model, in which task difficulty modulates drift rate, boundary separation, and starting-point bias, is strongly supported by LOO cross-validation and shows acceptable fit to subject-wise mid-body RT quantiles. Key findings—difficulty effects on v, a, and z; task-specific processing differences; and small effort effects—are robust across multiple sensitivity analyses. While the base Wiener DDM shows localized misfit in fast tails (especially Easy/VDT), this does not undermine the core substantive conclusions. Future extensions incorporating across-trial variability, urgency, or mixture models may further improve absolute fit.

## S4. Sensitivity Analysis: Exclusion of Sub-Chance Participants

To verify that the inclusion of 12 participants who performed at or below chance (≤55% accuracy) in some conditions did not bias our main findings, we conducted sensitivity analyses comparing the primary model (N=67) with models fit after excluding these participants (N=55).

**Method**: We refit the primary model (Model3_Difficulty) and an additive model (Model4_Additive) on the reduced dataset excluding sub-chance participants. Parameter estimates were compared using delta (sensitivity - baseline) with conservative 95% credible intervals. If the delta CI includes zero and the baseline and sensitivity CIs overlap, we conclude the parameter is robust to exclusion.

if (!is.null(sensitivity_summary)) {
  # Function to clean model names (reuse from LOO table)

**Results**: Most key parameters showed robust estimates when excluding sub-chance participants. For Model3_Difficulty and Model4_Additive, the drift intercept and boundary separation showed delta CIs that included zero, indicating no meaningful change. The Easy difficulty effect was also robust. The Hard difficulty effect showed a small shift (Δ ≈ -0.10, delta CI did not include zero), but this represents a small change in magnitude (\~6.5% of the baseline estimate) and does not alter the substantive conclusion that Hard trials show negative drift relative to Standard. **Conclusion**: The inclusion of sub-chance participants did not meaningfully alter main effects or substantive conclusions, supporting our decision to retain all 67 participants to maximize sample size and leverage hierarchical modeling's ability to stabilize estimates through shrinkage.
