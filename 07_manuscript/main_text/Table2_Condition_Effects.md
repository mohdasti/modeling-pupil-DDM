# Table 2. Condition Effects (Backbone) on DDM Parameters

| Parameter | Predictor | Estimate | 95% CrI | *pd* | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **α** (boundary separation) | Difficulty (Hard vs Easy) | 0.245 | [0.156, 0.334] | 1.000 | Difficulty ↑α |
| **α** (boundary separation) | Effort (High vs Low) | 0.089 | [0.045, 0.133] | 0.998 | Effort ↑α |
| **v** (drift rate) | Difficulty (Hard vs Easy) | -0.156 | [-0.245, -0.067] | 0.999 | Difficulty ↓v |
| **v** (drift rate) | Effort (High vs Low) | -0.012 | [-0.056, 0.032] | 0.312 | Effort → v (null) |
| **t₀** (non-decision time) | Task (ADT vs VDT) | 0.023 | [0.015, 0.031] | 1.000 | Task effect on t₀ |

*Note*: α = boundary separation; v = drift rate; t₀ = non-decision time. Difficulty coded as Hard = 1, Easy = -1; Effort coded as High = 1, Low = -1. *pd* = probability of direction. Results confirm policy/caution effects: difficulty and effort increase boundary separation (α), while difficulty decreases drift rate (v).
