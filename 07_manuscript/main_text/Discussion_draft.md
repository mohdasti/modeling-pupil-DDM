## Summary of Key Findings

The current study examined the relationship between pupillometry-measured arousal and decision-making processes using hierarchical drift diffusion modeling. Three key findings emerged: (1) Experimental manipulations produced a policy-over-evidence pattern with arousal primarily affecting boundary separation (α) rather than drift rate (v), (2) the slope feature (200–900 ms) dominated phasic feature selection with 92.2% model support, and (3) **trial-wise phasic arousal did not modulate serial choice bias**, despite optimal feature selection and comprehensive testing.

## Policy-Over-Evidence Pattern

Consistent with prior work on arousal and decision-making [references], difficulty and effort conditions primarily shifted boundary separation, suggesting that arousal manipulations affect response caution rather than evidence quality. This policy-over-evidence account is supported by the robust effects on boundary separation (difficulty: *α* = 0.245, *pd* = 1.000; effort: *α* = 0.089, *pd* = 0.998) and the finding that drift rate tracked task difficulty (*v* = -0.156 for difficulty, *pd* = 0.999) but showed minimal response to effort manipulations.

## Null Phasic × Serial-Bias Result

**Critical null finding**: Despite optimal feature selection (slope, 200–900 ms), comprehensive testing across multiple modeling frameworks (GLMER, HDDM), and quartile-binned analyses, trial-wise phasic arousal did not modulate serial choice bias (prev-choice × phasic slope interaction: β = -0.069, *SE* = 0.104, 95% CI [−0.275, 0.142], *p* = .506; see Table 4). This null finding was highly consistent across frameworks (GLMER: β = -0.069; HDDM: β = -0.065) and robust across different analytic approaches. The absence of phasic modulation suggests that serial choice bias operates independently of momentary arousal fluctuations in this paradigm.

## Boundary Conditions and Task-Specificity

The null finding for phasic arousal modulation of serial bias may reflect task-specific or paradigm-specific constraints. Several boundary conditions merit consideration:

1. **Trial-to-trial variability**: The 200–900 ms window captures phasic arousal during decision formation, but serial bias may operate on longer timescales or involve different mechanisms that are insensitive to trial-level fluctuations.

2. **Stimulus characteristics**: The oddball detection task may not engage arousal-dependent mechanisms that modulate serial bias in other paradigms (e.g., perceptual discrimination, value-based choice).

3. **Arousal intensity**: The present paradigm may not produce sufficient variability in phasic arousal to detect modulation effects, despite successful detection of tonic effects on boundary separation.

4. **Measurement precision**: Even with optimal feature selection (92.2% model support for slope), measurement noise or temporal misalignment may obscure small but reliable phasic effects on serial bias.

Importantly, these boundary conditions do not diminish the robustness of the null finding. Rather, they suggest that the absence of phasic modulation of serial bias is a meaningful and reproducible result that constrains theoretical accounts of arousal-dependent decision-making.

## Implications for Theory

The dissociation between tonic effects (on boundary separation) and phasic null effects (on serial bias) suggests that sustained and transient arousal states may engage distinct decision-making mechanisms. Sustained arousal (tonic) appears to adjust response caution through boundary separation, whereas transient arousal (phasic) does not modulate sequential choice dependencies in this paradigm. This dissociation aligns with accounts that emphasize tonic arousal as a background policy adjustment mechanism, distinct from trial-level evidence accumulation.

## Limitations and Future Directions

Several limitations should be considered. First, the null finding for phasic × serial bias interaction may reflect low statistical power, though the consistency across frameworks and approaches mitigates this concern. Second, the 39.1% data retention rate, while within acceptable ranges for pupillometry studies, may limit generalizability. Third, the paradigm-specific nature of the findings (oddball detection with force manipulation) may not generalize to other decision contexts.

Future work should explore (1) alternative phasic feature windows and metrics, (2) different task paradigms to test boundary conditions, (3) individual differences in phasic arousal sensitivity, and (4) computational models that explicitly test competing accounts of arousal-policy interactions.

## Conclusions

The present study provides clear evidence that arousal affects decision-making primarily through policy adjustments (boundary separation) rather than evidence quality (drift rate). The robust null finding for phasic modulation of serial bias constrains theoretical accounts and highlights the importance of distinguishing sustained (tonic) from transient (phasic) arousal states in decision-making research.
