# Table 4. Phasic Arousal Effects on Bias (z)

## Panel A: Winning Slope Model Main Effect on z

| Effect | Estimate | *SE* | 95% CI | *p* | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Phasic slope on z | -0.141 | 0.082 | [-0.302, 0.020] | 0.085 | Exploratory main effect |

## Panel B: Serial Bias Moderation

| Framework | Effect | Estimate | *SE* | 95% CI | *p* | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| GLMER | prev_choice × phasic slope | -0.069 | 0.104 | [-0.275, 0.142] | 0.506 | Not significant |
| HDDM | prev_choice × phasic slope | -0.065 | 0.098 | [-0.257, 0.127] | 0.512 | Not significant |

*Note*: Phasic main effect treated as exploratory (*p* = .085); serial bias moderation not significant (*p* > .50). z = starting point bias parameter. Phasic slope computed from 200–900 ms post-stimulus window.

> **KEY NULL RESULT (Pre-registered Test):** The critical test of phasic arousal modulation of serial choice bias was **not significant**: prev-choice × phasic slope (200–900 ms) on z, β = -0.069, *SE* = 0.104, 95% CI [−0.275, 0.142], *p* = .506. This null finding was replicated across both GLMER and HDDM frameworks with highly similar estimates. Quartile-binned analyses (Q1–Q4) showed no clear pattern of phasic modulation (see Supplementary Material S9), corroborating the absence of phasic arousal effects on serial choice bias in this paradigm.
