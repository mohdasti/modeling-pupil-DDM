### Caption

CONSORT-style flow diagram showing data screening and retention for the BAP pupillometry study. Of 987 total trials collected, 601 trials (60.9%) were removed due to RT outliers (< 200 ms or > 3,000 ms), and 215 trials (21.8%) were removed due to high missing pupil data (>40% missing). Final analysis included 386 trials (39.1% retention) from 26 participants.

### Screening Criteria

- **RT Outliers**: Response times < 200 ms (anticipatory responses) or > 3,000 ms (lapses)
- **Pupil Missing**: >40% missing pupil data points within trial window
- **Participant Inclusion**: Minimum 10 valid trials per participant
- **Task Completion**: Complete both ADT and VDT sessions

### Retention Statistics

| Screening Step | Trials | Percentage |
|---|---|---|
| Original dataset | 987 | 100.0% |
| After RT screening | 386 | 39.1% |
| After pupil screening | 386 | 39.1% |
| Final analysis set | 386 | 39.1% |

*Note*: No additional trials were removed after pupil screening, indicating that RT outliers and pupil missing data were largely non-overlapping exclusion criteria.
