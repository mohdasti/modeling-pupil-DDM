# Prompt for Finding RT Filtering Literature (250ms Cutoff for Older Adults in DDM)

## Research Question

I need to find peer-reviewed research papers that justify using a **250ms (0.250 seconds) lower-bound RT cutoff** for excluding anticipatory responses in drift diffusion model (DDM) analyses, specifically for **older adult populations (≥65 years)**.

## Context

**Study Design:**
- Response-signal task design
- RTs measured from response-screen onset (not stimulus onset)
- Participants: Older adults (≥65 years, mean age ≈71 years)
- Task: Change detection (auditory and visual)
- Response window: 0-3000ms (3 seconds maximum)

**Current Filtering:**
- Lower bound: RT < 250ms excluded as anticipations
- Upper bound: No filtering applied (3000ms is the maximum response window in the task design)

**Rationale Needed:**
I need evidence-based justification for the 250ms cutoff, specifically:
1. Why 250ms (vs. 200ms or 300ms) is appropriate for older adults
2. How this threshold relates to motor execution time in older populations
3. Whether this cutoff is standard practice in aging DDM research
4. Any studies that explicitly tested or validated this threshold for older adults

## Search Criteria

Please search for and provide:

1. **Primary papers** that:
   - Use DDM or diffusion modeling with older adults (≥65 years)
   - Explicitly report RT filtering thresholds (especially 200-300ms range)
   - Justify their choice of lower-bound RT cutoff
   - Discuss anticipatory response exclusion criteria

2. **Methodological papers** that:
   - Review RT filtering practices in cognitive aging research
   - Compare different RT cutoff thresholds (e.g., 200ms vs. 250ms vs. 300ms)
   - Discuss motor execution times in older adults
   - Address response-signal or deadline paradigms

3. **Key references** that:
   - Are frequently cited for RT filtering decisions in aging DDM studies
   - Provide empirical justification for specific thresholds
   - Discuss the relationship between age and minimum RT in decision-making tasks

## Specific Information Needed

For each relevant paper, please provide:

1. **Full citation** (APA format preferred)
2. **DOI or URL** (if available)
3. **Key finding/justification** (1-2 sentences about why they chose their RT cutoff)
4. **Population details** (age range, sample size if relevant)
5. **Task type** (if relevant - e.g., perceptual decision, change detection, etc.)
6. **RT cutoff used** (exact value in milliseconds)
7. **Rationale provided** (if explicitly stated in the paper)

## Priority Areas

1. **High priority**: Papers that:
   - Explicitly use 250ms as a cutoff
   - Test or compare different RT thresholds
   - Provide empirical justification based on older adult data
   - Are published in high-impact journals (Nature, Science, PNAS, Psychological Review, etc.)

2. **Medium priority**: Papers that:
   - Use similar cutoffs (200-300ms range) with older adults
   - Review methodological practices in aging DDM research
   - Discuss motor execution times in older populations

3. **Lower priority but useful**: Papers that:
   - Use DDM with older adults but don't explicitly justify RT cutoff
   - Review RT filtering in general (not aging-specific)
   - Discuss anticipatory responses in decision-making tasks

## Expected Output Format

Please provide a list of papers in the following format:

```
1. Author, A. A., Author, B. B., & Author, C. C. (Year). Title of paper. Journal Name, Volume(Issue), Pages. DOI: [if available]
   - RT cutoff: [value in ms]
   - Population: [age range, sample size]
   - Key justification: [1-2 sentence summary]
   - Relevance: [Why this paper supports 250ms cutoff for older adults]

2. [Next paper...]
```

## Additional Notes

- Focus on papers published in the last 20 years (2004-2024) if possible, but include seminal older papers if highly relevant
- Include both empirical studies and methodological/review papers
- Prioritize papers that explicitly discuss or justify their RT filtering choices
- If you find papers that recommend different thresholds (e.g., 200ms or 300ms), please include them with a note about why 250ms might be a reasonable middle ground

## Questions to Address

1. Is 250ms a commonly used threshold in aging DDM research?
2. Are there empirical studies that tested optimal RT cutoffs for older adults?
3. What is the typical motor execution time for older adults in button-press tasks?
4. How do response-signal designs affect the choice of RT cutoff?
5. Are there any papers that specifically recommend 250ms for older adult populations?
