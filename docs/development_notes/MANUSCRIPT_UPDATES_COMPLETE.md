# Manuscript Updates Complete ✅

**Date:** 2025-11-26  
**Status:** ✅ **All new visualizations and results integrated into QMD file!**

---

## Summary of Updates

All four new visualizations have been successfully integrated into `reports/chap3_ddm_results.qmd`:

### ✅ Plot 1: Drift Rate by Difficulty
- **Location:** Difficulty Effects section
- **File:** `plot1_drift_rate_by_difficulty.png`
- **Description:** Forest plot showing drift rate across Standard, Hard, and Easy trials
- **Key insight:** Demonstrates dramatic swing from negative drift (Standard/Hard) to positive drift (Easy)

### ✅ Plot 2: Bias by Task  
- **Location:** Bias Estimates section
- **File:** `plot2_bias_by_task.png`
- **Description:** Bar plot showing bias estimates for ADT vs VDT
- **Key insight:** ADT shows higher bias (0.573) than VDT (0.534)

### ✅ Plot 3: PPC Validation
- **Location:** Posterior Predictive Checks section
- **File:** `plot3_ppc_validation.png`
- **Description:** Histogram of predicted proportions with observed value
- **Key insight:** Model accurately predicts 11.2% vs observed 10.9% "Different" responses

### ✅ Plot 4: Parameter Correlation
- **Location:** Individual Differences and Parameter Relationships section
- **File:** `plot4_parameter_correlation.png`
- **Description:** Scatter plot of subject-level drift vs bias intercept
- **Key insight:** Weak negative correlation (r = -0.205) between drift and bias
