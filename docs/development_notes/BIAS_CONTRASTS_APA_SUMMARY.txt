# Bias Contrasts - APA-Ready Summary

## Standard-Only Model

### Bias Levels (Natural Scale, z parameter)

- **ADT, Low effort:** z = 0.567 (95% CrI: [0.534, 0.601])
- **VDT, Low effort:** z = 0.523 (95% CrI: [0.490, 0.556])
- **ADT, High effort:** z = 0.579 (95% CrI: [0.545, 0.612])

### Posterior Contrasts

**VDT - ADT (bias, logit scale):**
- Mean: -0.179 (95% CrI: [-0.259, -0.101])
- P(>0) = 0.000 (strongly negative)
- **Interpretation:** VDT has significantly lower bias toward "different" than ADT. On natural scale, VDT bias is ~4.4 percentage points lower than ADT.

**High - Low effort (bias, logit scale):**
- Mean: 0.048 (95% CrI: [-0.025, 0.120])
- P(>0) = 0.903 (positive but not strong)
- **Interpretation:** High effort shows slightly higher bias toward "different" than Low effort, but the effect is small and credible interval includes zero (negligible effect).

## Joint Model (Confirmation)

**VDT - ADT (bias, logit scale):**
- Mean: -0.100 (95% CrI: [-0.141, -0.059])
- P(>0) = 0.000 (strongly negative)
- **Interpretation:** Consistent with Standard-only model. VDT has significantly lower bias toward "different" than ADT. The effect is smaller in the joint model but still reliable.

## Consistency Check

Both models show:
- ✅ VDT has lower bias toward "different" than ADT (reliable effect)
- ✅ Effort has minimal effect on bias (negligible)
- ✅ Bias estimates are consistent across models (difference < 1%)

## APA-Style Reporting

**Standard-only model:** The task effect on bias was significant, with VDT showing lower bias toward "different" responses than ADT (Δ = -0.179, 95% CrI: [-0.259, -0.101], P(>0) < 0.001). The effort effect was negligible (Δ = 0.048, 95% CrI: [-0.025, 0.120], P(>0) = 0.903).

**Joint model:** Results were consistent with the Standard-only model, showing a reliable task effect (Δ = -0.100, 95% CrI: [-0.141, -0.059], P(>0) < 0.001).
