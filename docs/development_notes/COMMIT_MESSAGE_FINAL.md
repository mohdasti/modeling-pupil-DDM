# Commit Message: Final Manuscript Corrections and Verification

## Critical Fixes

1. **Fixed numeric contradiction in figure captions**:
   - Hard drift: Corrected from -1.88 to -0.64 (physically consistent)
   - Easy drift: Corrected from +1.76 to +0.90 (matches model estimates)
   - Standard drift: Updated to -1.23 for consistency
   - All values now verified against actual model estimates

2. **Updated manuscript to reflect correct bias specification**:
   - Bias does NOT vary by difficulty (methodologically correct)
   - Bias varies by task and effort only (pre-stimulus settings)
   - Updated all references throughout manuscript (Abstract, Methods, Results, Discussion)
   - Added explicit explanation of bias constraint in Methods section

3. **Regenerated all output files**:
   - Parameter extraction tables (Nov 27, 10:46)
   - Visualization figures (Nov 27, 10:46)
   - All files now reflect the new model (refitted Nov 27, 04:53)

## Documentation Added

- EXPERT_GUIDANCE_MODEL_COMPARISON_RESOLUTION.md: Expert guidance on model comparison
- ACTION_ITEMS_EXPERT_GUIDANCE.md: Action items checklist
- MANUSCRIPT_UPDATE_SUMMARY.md: Summary of manuscript updates
- FINAL_VERIFICATION_COMPLETE.md: Verification summary
- CRITICAL_FIX_APPLIED.md: Documentation of numeric fix

## Model Status

- Primary model refitted with correct bias specification (bias ~ task + effort, NO difficulty)
- Model converged successfully with excellent diagnostics
- All parameter estimates verified and consistent
- PPC validation passed (11.2% predicted vs 10.9% observed)

## Manuscript Status

✅ All numeric values verified and consistent
✅ All methodological descriptions accurate
✅ All figure captions corrected
✅ Ready for rendering and publication
